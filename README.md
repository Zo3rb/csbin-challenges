# 📘 CSBin.io Challenges

This repository contains my solutions, notes, and reflections while solving **[CSBin.io](https://csbin.io/)** challenges.  
The goal is to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, advanced concepts, and problem-solving skills — all documented in one place.

## 🚀 Why This Repo?

- Practice **JavaScript fundamentals** and **hard parts** in a structured way.
- Document solutions with explanations for future reference.
- Showcase progress and dedication to mastery in a public portfolio.

## ⚡️ Approach

I am intentionally using the most basic and straightforward ways to solve these challenges.  
Algorithmic patterns and advanced techniques (like multiple pointers, sliding windows, etc.) are **not** the focus here.  
The aim is to reinforce core concepts and ensure clarity, rather than optimize for performance or complexity.
